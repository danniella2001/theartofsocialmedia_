         <h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>
         <h2>Challenges / Misuse</h2>
         <p id="rcorners">One of the main problematics or challenges about the app Tiktok is likes. This creates a competitive environment where each person has to create a better video or have more likes and this can turn the app from being a great entertainment and learning space to a very negative and competitive space very quickly. 
            In our generation today  it’s all about success and whoever has  better this or that and with Tiktok viewers and creators see a video or “trend” doing well going viral and they tend to jump on the bandwagon, this can be a major challenge as a lot of the time the challenge or video trending could be harmful and through a platform so big as Tiktok with everyone doing it , it can be almost promoted for example in 2018 there was the “tide pods” challenge in which young children and teens would take clothing washing pods and put them in their mouth and bite them, this is obviously extremely dangerous but through the use of an app like Tiktok it began to be a trend that was “cool” so this is definitely a main challenge within this app.
         </p>
         <h2>Age Restriction and limits</h2>
         <p id="rcorners">Under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, The age restriction in  Ireland has now been set to the Digital Age of Consent.  Anyone under the age of 16 does not have legal access this platform. </p>
         <h2>Warnings</h2>
         <p id="rcorners">A few months ago www,chroniclelive.uk issued a statement about the dangers and warnings of Tiktok and how it can be misused, Schools across the UK were issued warning letters for parents of young children using the app and the dangers it can have. </p>
         <h2>Privacy and security issues</h2>
         <p id="rcorners">In January 2020 there was a security issue found in the app Tiktok. According to an article write by a cybersecurity firm checkpoint were to have found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, they could upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address.</p>
         <h2>Anti-Bullying </h2>
         <p id="rcorners">Tiktok has a section on the app rules and regulations about an anti-bullying policy and what they do to prevent bullying in their software, there list of how they improve and make sure there anti bullying policy stays in place is by approving who follows your account and having access to make your account private or public. You can delete a fan or block a user at any moment. This allows the user blocked to know longer view your profile or message you. 
            Report - Tiktok has an option to report a user or comment in which the app then must review this if a user feels in any way harassed.

         <!-----Using Tiktok for education and learning------>
         <h3>Using Tiktok for education and learning</h3>
         <p id="rcorners">Using social media for education is a big thing today. 
            Depending on the subject of learning Tiktok can use hashtags to
            specify what videos are for teaching/learning.
            Before even thinking about anything academic, Tiktok has been a place where you could learn something new. These include the popular video topic “life hacks”. This is where a
            user explains a trick to use in everyday life to make a certain task or chore a little more manageable. Other things you could learn from Tiktok also include cooking, fitness
            tips, and even how to do the most popular dance trends.
            The most obvious example of Tiktok being used for education however, is when the #EduTok programme was launched. This is a form of eLearning where users can post videos to teach others about various different topics, ranging from fitness workouts to
            solving mathematical equations. As of its launch, the genre of videos has received over 48 billion views on the app.
